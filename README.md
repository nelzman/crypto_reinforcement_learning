The initial idea was from youtube video for reinforcement-learning on stock-prediction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05NqKJ0v7EE  
The respective github-repo is https://github.com/llSourcell/Reinforcement_Learning_for_Stock_Prediction   
Today I would fork it and start from there, back in the day I didn't know better.
